# Unsmoothing of Alternative assets

## Alternative assets:

Alternative assets are assets with low liquidity such as Private Equity,commodities... Financial datas usually provided for thos kind of assets are usually given on a quarterly period. This leads to an effect of smoothing of the yields. The goal of this project is to implement several algorithms in order to unsmooth linear time series by adding several points to represent yields on shorter period of time.For instance, obtaining monthly return from quarterly returns. A web app is also devellopped to allow anyone to use the implemented algorithms.
Different mathematical methods will be implemented in order to do so. Those are all presented in the following read.me file. Requierments are precised in the requierments.txt attached file. This whole work is based on the following research paper: 2004-07 - Germansky, Lo, Makarov - An econometric model of serial correlation and illiquidity in hedge fund returns, 2020-11 - Couts, Goncalves, Rossi - Unsmoothing Returns of Illiquid Asset, 2007-03 - Investment Property Forum - Index Smoothing and the Volatility of UK Commercial Property, 2020-02 - Delfim, Hoesli - University of Aberdeen - Robust Desmoothed Real Estate Returns.
